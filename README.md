Ian Bent is a retired professor (Columbia University) of music, specializing in music theory. He has a particular interest in the work of Viennese music theorist Heinrich Schenker. 
Heinrich Schenker (1868-1935) developed, between 1906 and 1935, an innovative way of understanding and analysing Classical music. 
Schenker Documents Online is an online scholarly edition of the correspondence, diaries and other materials of Heinrich Schenker.  It aims to advance knowledge of the life and thought of the theorist, and to stimulate biographical study of him.
Schenkerâ€™s method of music analysis, demonstrated in his publications, was first introduced to the USA in 1931, and has been widely used there and many other countries since then, and has been employed to elucidate the music of composers such as Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Brahms, and more recent composers.
