-- Ian Bent, retired professor of music (Columbia University), specializes in the history of music theory. He has a particular interest in the work of Viennese music theorist Heinrich Schenker. -- William Drabkin, retired professor of music (University of Southampton), has written about Schenkerâ€™s theory, Beethovenâ€™s sketchbooks, chamber music, and opera.  

-- Heinrich Schenker (1868-1935) developed, between 1906 and 1935, an innovative way of understanding music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
-- Schenkerâ€™s method of music analysis, demonstrated in his publications, was first introduced to the USA in 1931; it is widely used there and in many other countries to elucidate the works not only of composers such as Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, and Brahms, but also those of earlier and later periods as well as music outside the Western classical tradition.

-- Schenker Documents Online is an web-based scholarly edition of the correspondence, diaries and other materials of Heinrich Schenker. It aims to advance knowledge of the life and thought of the theorist, and to stimulate biographical study of him. It is widely used by scholars, and is cited numerous times in scholarly books and journal articles.
